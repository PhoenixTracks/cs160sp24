# Phoenix Tracks

Welcome to Phoenix Tracks, a transformative platform designed to assist non-violent ex-convicts in reintegrating into society through employment opportunities. This project emerged from our research, which included observations and interviews with our target audience. They shared their challenges with us: "Imagine being part of society, where you have access to everything, and then having it all taken away, yet you are asked to reintegrate into society a long time after." Phoenix Tracks is our answer to make this transition smoother.
